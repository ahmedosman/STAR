## Description

STAR - A **S**parse **T**rained  **A**rticulated Human Body **R**egressor is a generateive 3D human body model, that is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the widely used SMPL model.
STAR is trained on a large dataset of 14,000 human subjects, with a learned set of sparse and spatially local pose corrective 
blend shapes. In the Figure below, a single joint movement only influences a sparse set of the model vertices. The mesh vertices in 
gray are not affected by the joint movement. In contrast, for SMPL, bending the left elbow causes a bulge in the right elbow.  <br/>
STAR is publicly avaiable with the full 300 principal-component shape space for research purposes from our website https://star.is.tue.mpg.de/

## Content
This repository contains the model loader for the following auto-differention frameworks:
* PyTorch. 
* Tensorflow 2.0.
* Chumpy.

Code tested on Python 3.69, CUDA 10.1, CuDNN 7.6.5 and PyTorch 1.6.0, Tensorflow 2.3, Chumpy 0.69 on Ubuntu 18.04

## Installation 

### Install 

We recommend doing the following in a python3 virtual environment.

1. Clone the repository: 

```Shell
git clone git@github.com:ahmedosman/STAR.git
```
2. Install your favorite framework <br/>
Chumpy
```
pip install chumpy==0.69
pip install opencv-python
```

PyTorch
```
pip install pytorch==1.6
```

Tensorflow
```
pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.3
```
5. Download the models from our website https://star.is.tue.mpg.de/

6. Update the model paths in the config.py file.
```python
path_male_star = '/mypath/male/model.npz'
path_female_star = '/mypath/female/model.npz'
path_neutral_star = '/mypath/neutral/model.npz'
```

Alternatively, place a file called `star.ini` in your user home directory, i.e.
- Linux: `/home/username/star.ini`
- Windows: `C:\Users\username\star.ini`
- MacOs: `/Users/username/star.ini`

The `star.ini` file should specify the paths, e.g.
```
[DEFAULT]
path_male_star = /Users/username/star_1_1/male/model.npz
path_female_star = /Users/username/star_1_1/female/model.npz
path_neutral_star = /Users/username/star_1_1/neutral/model.npz
data_type = float32
```

7. Install with pip
```
pip install .
```

### Usage

Under demos/* there are scripts demonstrating how to load and use the model in all frameworks. 
```bash
    $PATH_TO_REPO/
    ├── demos
    │   │
    │   ├── compare_frameworks.py #Unit test script constructing the model with three frameworks and comparing the output
    │   └── load_chumpy.py        #A script demonstrating loading the model in chumpy
    │   └── load_tf.py            #A script demonstrating loading the model in Tensorflow
    │   └── load_torch.py         #A script demonstrating loading the model in PyTorch
    │   └── profile_tf.py         #A script profiling the STAR graph as a function of batch Size in Tensorflow
    |   └── profile_torch.py      #A script profiling the STAR graph as a function of batch Size in PyTorch
```

## SMPL Comparison 
STAR is designed to be a drop in replacement for SMPL, similar to SMPL it is parameterised with pose and shape parameters, with the same template
resolution and kinematic tree.
